## Project Description
● The project involves delving into the automotive industry and its rapidly evolving landscape over
the past few decades.
● The focus on fuel selection has been increasingly depending on factors such as fuel efficiency,
technological innovation and environmental sustainability.
● The consumer demand for cars is also in the grip of increasing competition among manufacturers
and a changing consumer landscape.
● Hybrid/Electric vehicle adoption. Increased interest in fuel sources such as hydrogen/natural gases.
● Goal - optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability, meeting
consumer demand.
## Approach 
● The first step - download the dataset and perform data cleaning
● Next step - Analyze relationship between key variables -
○ Car Features
○ Market Category
○ Pricing
● Identifying which features/categories most popular among consumers and most profitable for manufacturer.
● Pricing Strategy can be developed using -
○ Regression Analysis
○ Market Segmentation
● Can help -
○ Balance consumer demand with profitability
○ Identify product features to focus future product development efforts.
○ Manufacturer improve competitiveness in market
○ Increase profitability over time

## Result
Through this project, I have gained a thorough understanding of analyzing the impact of car features and
the profitability on the car_data csv dataset. I have been able to successfully complete the required task
analysis delving into topics like interactive dashboards for insights like popularity of car model across
different market categories, engine power vs price, determining strongest features and calculating the
coefficient variable for regression analysis.
The relationships between variables like fuel efficiency and number of cylinders, car prices by body style
and brand, transmission type, fuel efficiency, HP etc. have all been analyzed along with the relevant
insights. The data has been visualized using various charts like line, bar, column, bubble etc.
