# Instagram User Analytics

## About 
- This project is about providing insights on the questions asked by the product manager at the product team at Instagram.
- The questions are asked by the management team and we are working with the product team of Instagram.
- These insights are then used by teams across the business to launch a new marketing campaign, decide on features to build for the app and track the success of the app.
- We are going to create a database that stores the relevant data. SQL will be used to perform the entire analysis answering the questions asked by the management team.

## Approach
The approach of the project firstly involves downloading the dataset file which is an office open xml file.
Then, we create a new SQL script in the MySQL workbench. After this, the database commands are
executed. This creates a new database in the workbench named ‘ig_clone’.
The next step is to perform analysis using MYSQL queries to answer the questions asked by the
management.

## Tech-Stack Used
1. MySQL Workbench v8.0.33 build 2947366 CE(64 bits) Community Edition.

Purpose - To create the initial database and perform the entire analysis answering the
questions.

## Result
This project has helped me to gain a good understanding of how MYSQL workbench works, how MySQL
queries work, and how it can be leveraged to extract meaningful insights from an existing database. I
think I have achieved the knowledge to infer from patterns that exist in the underlying data. Specifically, I
learned about user analysis and how it can be used to track user engagement and interaction with the
digital product (which can be a mobile or software-based application). It can then be used to derive
business insights for marketing, product, and development teams. I also gained an understanding of how a
product team operates, and what are the processes that go into launching campaigns as part of the
marketing team and investor metrics for the key stakeholders.
