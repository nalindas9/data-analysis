## Project Description

In this project, the primary objective is to utilize EDA for Risk Analytics in the Banking and
Financial Services sector and how data is utilized to minimize the risk of depleting
financials while lending to customers. This can occur when the consumer is defaulting on
the previous loans based on insufficient or non-existent credit history. The objective of this
EDA is to analyze patterns in the Data. This Dataset could be recovered from for eg. a
consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban
customers. Analyzing the Dataset for uncovering the relevant patterns ensures that the
applicants capable of repaying the loans are not rejected. In other words, the company
seeks to gain an understanding of the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan
defaults. The company can then utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk
assessment. Finally, to reiterate, the identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim
of this case study.

## Approach
My approach for the project would be to first download the dataset, identifying and
removing data outliers, identifying trends, uncovering patterns, creating hypothesis, and
identifying new sources of data. Since the objective is to use EDA to understand how
consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of a default, I’ll be
undertaking an independent research about the risk analytics - understanding the types of
variables and their significance. I’ll be providing a detailed report for the data record by
answering the questions like - presenting the overall approach of the analysis identifying
the missing data and using appropriate methods to deal with it, identifying outliers in the
dataset and the reason of occurrence, identifying the possibility of a data imbalance,
explaining the results of the univariate, segmented univariate and bivariate analysis,
finding the top 10 correlation for the clients with payment difficulties and
visualizing/summarizing the outcomes in the presentation.

## Tech-Stack Used
1. Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets
Purpose: Used to perform the entire analysis by deriving the relevant insights.

## Result
Through this project, I have gained a good understanding of the various excel
statistical tool and methods for analysis on large datasets through exploratory data
analysis (EDA). Specifically, I have merged two large datasets - application_data
and previous_application. I have successfully identified missing data and have dealt
with it appropriately to enhance the accuracy of the analysis. I have also identified
outliers in the dataset that could have significantly impacted and distorted the
analysis. I have determined the data imbalance in the dataset which can result in a
biased estimate of the analysis. I have also performed Univariate, Segmented
Univariate and Bivariate Regression Analysis to further gain insights into the key
factors in a load default. Finally, the top correlations for different scenarios have
been observed. The data has been visualized using various charts and graphs like
histograms, pie, bar, scatter plots etc.
