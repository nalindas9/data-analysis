##### Application in Real Life Scenario Case Study / PPT

## Case Study 1:

Description:
Shopping Online on E-Commerce Websites like Amazon/Flipkart
Plan
We first ponder or get an idea on what is it we need to buy online. It could be something like buying a Mobile Phone or a pair of
Headphones.
Prepare
Next, we need to check how much to spend and if it fits the budget we have in mind.
Process
Next we need to identify what we wish to extract from the data - Like if are buying a phone, what specifications of the phone are we
looking for - RAM/Camera/OS/Battery Life etc.We also check the reviews provided by customers who have already bought the
product.
Analyze
We then need to check if the phone we are going to buy fits our current needs. Is it going to be more of a utility accessory which helps
us make our daily lives easier or do we care more about the brand. The color of the phone should also match where we intend to use it
in our day-to-day lives.
Share
Now we put our requirements information into the websites filters.
Act
We then finally checkout and buy it!

## Case Study 2:
Description:
Cooking is an integral part of our day-to-day lives, We can make use of Data Analytics for this purpose.
Plan
The first step here would to plan out what to make. What would be some of the ingredients? For example we could decide to make
pasta.
Prepare
Next, I need to check how much I am willing to spend on groceries and what would be the ingredients to use.
Process
The next step would be to decide what are the kind of groceries I would like to order or buy? The groceries could include the pasta
shells, vegetables, oil, pasta sauce etc.
Analyze
We then need to check if the ingredients would make a good combination. What would be the recipe we are trying to use? The recipe
could include using white or red sauce.
Share
Next we share the recipe with our friends and family.
Act
Finally we get to consume it!

## Case Study 3:
Description:
Data Analytics can also be used when we are going out to buy for example a cake for a birthday for a friend.
Plan
We first ask, what kind of cake would my friend like? Is it Chocolate, Vanilla, Truffle etc?
Prepare
Next we need to figure out the cost of the cake and how much are we willing to spend.
Process
Now we then check for further data - if we want a cake, what should the cake include,how big should be the cake, should it include
anything written on top of it?
Analyze
We then need to check what combination of the above criterias would be be liked by our friend. Would it be Chocolate icing plus vanilla
base? Or truffle without icing?
Share
Then we communicate our custom idea to the shopkeeper to check for availability and suitable fit
Act
We then buy the cake!

## Case Study 4:
Description:
Some of the biggest media companies like Netflix/Amazon Prime use Data Analytics to identify and personalize content to particular
audience and customer.
Plan
We first ask, what platform should we watch the movie or tv show on? Is it Netflix or Amazon Prime?
Prepare
Next is to decide how much money am I willing to spend, and whether the subscription cost would fit our budget.
Process
Next we need to check how much we want from the data. Like if we decide on Netflix, what genre of the tv show or movie we want to
watch - Action, Comedy, Horror etc.
Analyze
We then need to check for other things, like if the movie or tv show is popular and trending. We might decide to watch something from
the top 10 streaming shows or most popular in a particular genre. We need to check if the chosen platform has the content we have in
mind.
Share
Next we select the options we have in mind according to the chosen preferences.
Act
We then finally buy the subscription!

## Case Study 5:
Description:
Data Analytics also finds its applications in healthcare. For eg. We can go to the pharmacy store to get some medicines.
Plan
We could first ask what kind of medicines we need? It could be something we need for headaches, cold etc.
Prepare
We then need to check if if we have a valid prescription for the health issue.We also need to check if we have the money or a valid
health insurance to pay for the same.
Process
We then need to further dive into the data. We need to check if we are getting medicines for cold, what type of cold are we going to get
the medicine for - common cold, viral, influenza etc.
Analyze
We then need to analyze and find out how much dosage we need, what would be the appropriate times of the day we would take it
and if there are no allergies that can occur due to consuming it.
Share
We then communicate our requirements to the pharmacist who will then arrange for the medications.
Act
We then finally pay and checkout!
