Advanced SQL
## About 
The project involves delving into operations analytics. This involves working closely with the ops, support, and
marketing teams, to derive insights from the data. This analysis is used for more effective and better workflows,
better automation, and understanding between cross-functional teams.
This also includes investing metric spikes which are an integral part of the operation analytics. This helps teams
understand important questions in the data like a dip in daily user engagement or a sudden dip in sales.
SQL will be used to perform the entire analysis answering the questions asked by the different departments.Finally,
we’ll be able to derive useful insights from the job data and metric spike investigation.

## Approach
The approach for this project involves performing operation analytics for a company that will
oversee its end-to-end operations. This will help the company gain insights into which areas it can
improve on.
This analysis would help in predicting the overall growth or decline of a company’s fortune. To
carry out this analysis, SQL would be used.
The datasets are downloaded which contain the relevant tables we need to carry out for our
analysis. There are two case studies that are addressed as part of the project - Deriving
insights from job data and investigating metric spikes.

## Tech-Stack Used
1. MySQL Workbench v8.0.33 build 2947366 CE(64 bits) Community Edition.

Purpose - To create the initial database and perform the entire analysis answering
the questions.
2. Excel/Sheets

## Sample query outputs
### Amount of users growing over time for a product.

## Result
This project has helped me to obtain a broader insight into how MYSQL can be used to leverage
the transformational impact of data and analytics for the end-to-end operations of a company. I
learned about how this kind of insight can be used to predict the overall growth or decline of a
company. Better Automation and better understanding between cross-functional teams can lead to
more effective workflows. I also learned about investigating metrics spikes, which are sudden
growth or decline in certain metrics in the data, which can have an impact on the overall graph.
