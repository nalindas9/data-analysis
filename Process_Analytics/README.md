# Process_Analytics

## Project Description
This project is about one of the most fundamental and crucial functions in a
company - Process Analytics. Being a Data Analyst, drawing insights and
trends for the team to work on is also one of the important roles.
Many MNCs rely on it to derive underlying trends about the process
such as types of jobs, vacancies, number of interviews, etc. Our role here is
that we are working for an MNC like XYZ as Lead Data Analyst and the
company has provided a set of data records of previous recruits and has
asked to make sense of the data.

## Approach
My approach towards the project involves first gathering the dataset and
downloading it. The next step would be to use my knowledge of statistics and
different formulas in Excel and draw necessary conclusions about the
company. For conducting the exploratory data analysis (EDA), we first need to
understand the data columns and the dataset itself. Then we need to check
for missing data. Then clubbing the columns with multiple categories, we need
to check for outliers and remove them. Then we need to derive the summary
from the data.

## Result
Through this project, I have learned how to conduct an exploratory data
analysis using Excel/sheets as the primary tool. The process insights are
derived and represented using charts and graphs. Specifically, charts, like the
pie chart were used to visualize proportions, and radar charts, were used to
visualize the spread of the data. Graphs like bar graphs, histograms, and 
line charts were used to represent the distribution of data along different
labels and intervals.
