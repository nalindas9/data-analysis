## Project Description

In this project, we are required to frame the problem. The questions that guide in framing the problem are as follows - what do
we see happening, what is the hypothesis for the cause of the problem, what is the impact of the crisis on stakeholders,
what is the impact of the problem not being solved. Once the problem is defined, we need to perform data cleaning, using the
5 whys approach in our analysis. This approach is also synonymous with the root cause analysis approach. It essentially
means asking questions for five iterations until we reach a conclusion. Itâ€™s primarily a top-down approach.
Hence we can frame the problem by examining the dataset. Since that dataset is about IMDB movie analysis. We can use our
knowledge gained now about various analytics processes to derive insights. We want to analyze trends like profit as a metric
of budget for various movies, ranking movies based on metrics like ratings and number of votes. These trends can help us to
identify the most popular films and actors. The stakeholders here could be the management team. The impact of the problem
not being solved could be a reduction in viewer engagement, reduced ott subscriptions, etc.

## Approach

My approach towards the project involves first downloading the dataset. We then have to perform
analysis using excel/google sheets answering the questions asked by the IMDB team. We want to take
into account some of the key factors that can influence our data analysis. For eg. we can be asked why we
went over budget on a project. It could be that it took more time to complete. Why did it take longer?
Redesign of several elements might have been needed for the product. Then why redesign? Could be that
some features were a little complex to use. Why were the features complex? Could be that the initial
requirements of what users wanted was incorrect. Why incorrect assumptions? Could be that the user
experience team did not ask the full spectrum of questions. Hence this kind of 5 whys approach helps us
identify root cause of of the problem.

### Result
In this project, I think I have applied my previous knowledge of using Excel as a data analysis tool to derive
important insights. I have achieved cleaning up the data before carrying out the analysis, deriving movies
with the highest profit and while observing the outliers, deriving the top 250 movies with the highest
IMDb metrics and the top foreign language movies, finding the top 10 directors for whom the IMDb score
is the highest, finding the most popular genres, finding the critic and audience-favorite actors and
observing and plotting the change in the number of voted users in each decade. Through this project, I have
acquired a strong understanding of the various data analytics techniques and also attained an advanced
excel and statistical understanding.
